Automated Aiming Device Simulation

Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simulation-based automated aiming system. The system uses PyBullet for robotic arm simulation, integrates a virtual camera for target detection, and employs a control algorithm to track and aim at a moving target.

The key features include:

A robotic arm simulation using the KUKA iiwa URDF model.
Real-time target tracking with smooth movements.
Simulation of environmental constraints (e.g., obstacles).
